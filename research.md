# Physical Oceanography

The dynamics of the oceans at large scales plays a critical role in the the evolution of the Earth's climate.  
The research group studies wind-driven gyres, oceanic jets and vortices, all of which are inherently nonlinear and therefore difficult to model.  One of the fundamental questions in the field is to better
understand how the energy added at the planetary scales cascades through all scales, eventually being dissipated at the microscales.
