This group consists of Professor Poulin, graduate and undergraduate students 
in the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/) 
or the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://uwaterloo.ca/physics-astronomy/) 
at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). 
Some of these individuals are part of the [Interdisciplinary Centre on Climate Change](https://uwaterloo.ca/climate-centre/).

We use mathematical models to idealize problems in 
* Physical Oceanography
* Biologcial Oceanography
* Solar Physics
* Computational Fluid Dynamics

A general focus is to study nonlinear processes in a continuum, where common examples are jets and vortices. An active area of research is to further develop software to facilitate research in these areas.  Look in the research tab to find out more about the research and software.
