This group consists of Professor Poulin, as well as graduate and undergraduate students. Group members have expertise in developing analytical models to describe aspects of the world and then using numerical software to simulate the solution to this model.  These simulations can be thought of as experiments _in silica_ and are used to determine the limits of the model, but also to make predictions as to what we should expect to observe in reality.  

Areas of expertise of this group include: 
* Physical Oceanography
* Biological Oceanography
* Solar Physics
* Computational Fluid Dynamics

A focus is to study nonlinear processes in a fluid dynamics, important examples are jets and vortices. An active area of research is to further develop software to facilitate research in these areas.  Look in the research tab to find out more about the research and software.
