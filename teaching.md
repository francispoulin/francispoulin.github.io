Professor Poulin teaches courses in Applied Mathematics that typically have a lot of Physics

- MATH 137P (Calculus 1, Physics-Based) -- **Fall, 2022**
- AMATH 231 (Vector Calculus)
- AMATH 271 (Theoretical Mechanics) -- **Fall, 2022**
- AMATH 351 (Ordinary Differential Equations 1)
- AMATH 353 (Partial Differential Equations 1)
- AMATH 361 (Continuum Mechanics) -- **Winter, 2022**
- AMATH 463 (Fluid Mechanics)
- AMATH 900 (Computational Physical Oceanography)

Professor Poulin has writtenlecture notes for many of these courses.

### Teaching Philosophy

Mathematics can be used to describe many aspects of the world in the language of Calculus.  Many of these courses explore how to describe some aspect
of the world using a mathematical model and then how to learn about the scientific problem by solving the equations either analytically or numerically.
